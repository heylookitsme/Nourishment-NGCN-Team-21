         <p>This is us! Members of this team are from the U.S., Iraq-Kurdistan region, and Palestine. <br> 
            They started working on this website/project during the week of February 16th. They brainstormed ideas ranging from global <br> 
            awareness for violence against women to advocating for the distribution of factual information about COVID-19, <br> 
            before deciding on the topic of water and food insecurity. They researched the topic and found resources that would aid in either <br>
            creating the website or ensuring every member knew what work had to be completed. Within 10 weeks, this team created the website <br>
            you're viewing now. This team thanks you for engaging with this website, and hopes it will do some good to those that need help or education <br>
            on water and food insecurity.</font></p>
